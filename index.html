            <H2>About me</H2>
            <p>Hello!👋 I’m passionate about creativity and personal growth.
                Currently, I’m deeply immersed in Computer Science and focused on becoming better every day.
                I enjoy building projects that combine logic and design, allowing me to express both technical skill and
                creative flair.

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>I enjoy engaging in a variety of activities during my free time, whether
                I am unwinding after a long day or actively working on developing new skills.
                These activities allow me to maintain a healthy balance between relaxation and self-improvement, helping
                me stay focused, creative, and continuously growing</p>

                <h3>FIFA</h3>
                <img src="Assets/Fifa.jpeg" alt="Fifa  Gameplay">
                <P>After a long day of grinding, I’m always ready to jump into a FIFA match with the boys.
                    It’s one of my favorite ways to kick back, have fun, and enjoy some competitive energy.
                    Whether we’re playing intense matches, trying out new tactics, or battling to see who is the best,
                    the
                    excitement never gets old. Playing FIFA helps me unwind, sharpen my gameplay, and improve my
                    strategic thinking, while also giving me a chance to connect with friends and share laughs.
                    It’s more than just a game to me it’s a perfect blend of relaxation, competition, and social time.
                </P>
                <h3>Fortnite:</h3>
                <img src="Assets/Fortnite.jpeg" alt="Fortnight gameplay">
                <p>Fortnite is a massive online game where a hundred players drop onto an island to compete in a fun, cartoon-style battle royale. 
                    One of the things I enjoy most is that you can gather resources like wood and metal to build your own defensive walls and ramps mid-game. 
                    It is always changing with new seasons, adding cool crossovers with movies and musicians that keep the map feeling fresh and exciting. 
                    When I'm not in a competitive mood, I love exploring the Creative mode where you can build your own custom islands or play mini-games with friends. 
                    It’s a great way to hang out virtually and work together as a squad to try and earn a Victory Royale! 
                    The game features a colorful art style that makes even the most intense battles feel lighthearted and entertaining. 
                    I really like how you can express yourself through different "skins" and emotes, making every character on the field look unique. 
                    The island is filled with hidden secrets and lore, so there is always something new to discover behind every hill or building. 
                    Learning the map's layout and finding the best places to find loot has become one of my favorite parts of the gameplay experience.

                <h3>Fitness Training</h3>
                <img src="Assets/Fitness.jpeg" alt="Fitness Therapy">

                <p>Fitness training has become a huge part of my daily routine because it helps me feel energized and focused for the day ahead. 
                    I usually start my gym sessions with a quick warm-up to get my heart rate going and prevent any unwanted injuries. 
                    One of the things I enjoy most is the variety of equipment available, from heavy free weights to high-tech rowing machines.
                    It is really satisfying to track my progress over time, especially when I notice I can lift more or run further than the week before. 
                    When I'm not doing strength training, I like to mix things up with some stretching or mobility work to keep my body feeling flexible. 
                    The gym environment is quite social too, as it’s a great place to meet people who share similar health goals and interests. 
                    I find that listening to a high-energy playlist or an interesting podcast makes the time fly by during a tough workout session. 
                    Learning about proper form and nutrition has been a really rewarding part of this journey as it keeps me moving safely and efficiently.
                    Overall, it’s not just about the physical results but also about the mental clarity I get every time I finish a good session!</p>
