            <H2>About me</H2>
            <p>Hello!👋 I’m passionate about creativity and personal growth.
                Currently, I’m deeply immersed in Computer Science and focused on becoming better every day.
                I enjoy building projects that combine logic and design, allowing me to express both technical skill and
                creative flair.

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>I enjoy engaging in a variety of activities during my free time, whether
                I am unwinding after a long day or actively working on developing new skills.
                These activities allow me to maintain a healthy balance between relaxation and self-improvement, helping
                me stay focused, creative, and continuously growing</p>

                <h3>FIFA</h3>
                <img src="Assets/Fifa.jpeg" alt="Fifa  Gameplay">
                <P>After a long day of grinding, I’m always ready to jump into a FIFA match with the boys.
                    It’s one of my favorite ways to kick back, have fun, and enjoy some competitive energy.
                    Whether we’re playing intense matches, trying out new tactics, or battling to see who is the best,
                    the
                    excitement never gets old. Playing FIFA helps me unwind, sharpen my gameplay, and improve my
                    strategic thinking, while also giving me a chance to connect with friends and share laughs.
                    It’s more than just a game to me it’s a perfect blend of relaxation, competition, and social time.
                </P>
                <h3>Fortnite:</h3>
                <img src="Assets/Fortnite.jpeg" alt="Fortnight gameplay">
                <p>Fortnite isn’t just a game it’s a wild, unpredictable playground where anything can happen.
                    Picture a world splashed with color, where you’re dropped onto an island with nothing but your wits,
                    your
                    pickaxe, and a dream of outlasting everyone else. I dive in every time with a mix of hope and
                    excitement
                    One moment, I’m scavenging loot like I actually know what I’m doing; the next, I’m running for my
                    life from
                    someone who can build an entire skyscraper before I can even place a single wall. The chaos is part
                    of the charm.
                    It’s fast-paced, hilarious, and never the same twice.
                    Sometimes I pull off epic plays that make me feel like a legend; other times, I accidentally launch
                    myself off a cliff
                    or get eliminated in the most ridiculous way possible. Win or lose, it’s always a blast especially
                    when
                    I’m hanging out with my squad, laughing at our fails and celebrating those Victory Royales.
                    Fortnite is all about creativity, madness, and having fun, and that’s exactly why I keep coming
                    back.</p>

                    Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of
                    classical Latin literature from
                    45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney
                    College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,
                    consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the
                    word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes
                    from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus</p>

                    There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered
                    alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly
                    believable.
                    If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to
                    be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.
                    All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary</p>
