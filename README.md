## Reflection on what you learned during this project

During this project, I leraned how to plan, design and build a multi-page webiste using HTML and CSS. I improved my understaning
of layout techniques. I really enjoyed this project because I gained experience with organising files and writing reusable code.
In the beginning of the project I had a baisc understanding of HTML and CSS but as I was going on with the project I understood how 
things work. Overall this project helped me grow both technically and creatively
